JMF based Java Audio Player
Problem Statement: 
The clientâ€™s requirement was to create a media player in Java to enhance their delivery of technical education.

Highlights:
1. Developed as desktop application which dealt with the real time multime- dia presentation & effect processing
2. User was able to know the metadata information while playing a time based media whether in audio (.mp3) or video (.mpg or .mpeg) format.
3. Menu-bar was reduced in size which resulted in a graphical user interface only.
4. User could save the song list as .m3u file which is a standard and oldest format to be read by all other players.
